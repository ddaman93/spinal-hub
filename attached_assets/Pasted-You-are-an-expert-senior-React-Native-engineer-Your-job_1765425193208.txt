You are an expert senior React Native engineer.  
Your job is to generate a clean, correct, maintainable **Expo React Native + TypeScript** project shell for my app called **Spinal Hub**.  
This is a real project for a C5 quadriplegic user — accessibility, clarity, and simplicity are critical.  
Do not hallucinate libraries.  
Do not break imports.  
Do not skip files.  
Do not rename components without updating paths.  
Do not output placeholder code that cannot run.  
Every screen must import correctly.

--------------------------------------------------
APP OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
Spinal Hub is a personal health + daily management app that includes:

1. **Dashboard Screen**
   - A 3-column grid of category tiles.
   - Tiles have icons, labels, and animated press effects.
   - Categories:
       • Daily Routine  
       • Health Tracking  
       • Care & Support  
       • Appointments  
       • Life Management  
       • Custom Tools  
   - A floating microphone button at the bottom center.
   - A voice status bar that appears when listening.
   - Voice feedback through text‐to‐speech.

2. **Category Detail Screen**
   - Shows the category title.
   - Placeholder list of tools inside that category.

3. **Theme + Styling System**
   - Light + dark themes.
   - Shared constants:
       • Spacing  
       • Typography  
       • Colors  
       • BorderRadius  
   - A hook: `useTheme()` that returns `{ theme, isDark }`

4. **Navigation**
   Use React Navigation (Native Stack):
   - `Dashboard`
   - `CategoryDetail`
   - Screens must have typed params using TypeScript:
     e.g. `MainStackParamList = { Dashboard: undefined; CategoryDetail: { category: string; title: string }; }`

5. **Voice System**
   - Use `expo-speech` for speaking.
   - Include a placeholder function for speech recognition (we will implement later).
   - The microphone button should animate when listening (pulse effect).
   - When pressed, it toggles listening state.

6. **Accessibility**
   - All tiles must have accessible labels.
   - The microphone button must have `accessibilityLabel="Voice Control"`

YOUR TASK
--------------------------------------------------
Generate a complete, minimal but production-ready project shell with:

✔ Full folder structure  
✔ Correct file imports  
✔ Each file fully written (no “…” placeholders)  
✔ Working DashboardScreen with tile grid + animations  
✔ Working CategoryDetailScreen  
✔ Working theme system with hook  
✔ Working navigation  
✔ Working voice button animation  
✔ Clear placeholder spaces for future features  
✔ Zero errors, zero missing imports

--------------------------------------------------
FOLDER STRUCTURE REQUIRED
--------------------------------------------------

/App.tsx
/navigation/
    MainStackNavigator.tsx
/screens/
    DashboardScreen.tsx
    CategoryDetailScreen.tsx
/components/
    ThemedText.tsx
    VoiceButton.tsx
    CategoryTile.tsx
/constants/
    theme.ts
/hooks/
    useTheme.ts
/types/
    navigation.ts

--------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL RULES
--------------------------------------------------
• Write code using React Native + Expo Router conventions.  
• Use only libraries that ship with Expo or can be installed with `expo install`.  
• Use Reanimated for animation only if necessary (you may use it just for the tile/mic button animations).  
• Ensure all code compiles with TypeScript.  
• Do not invent API endpoints or backend logic.  
• Keep screens minimal, clean, and fully functional.  

--------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT
--------------------------------------------------
Format your answer like this:

1. Show the final folder structure.
2. Provide each file’s full TypeScript code in separate blocks, with correct imports.
3. Ensure that the resulting code can be pasted into a fresh Expo project and run immediately.
